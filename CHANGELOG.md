## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Architecture guide with ASCII diagrams covering on-flash layout, in-RAM data structures, PEB lifecycle, device initialization flow, and wear-leveling strategy (`doc/architecture.md`).
- Development roadmap with prioritized feature list (`doc/roadmap.md`).
- Contributor guide with code style, build/test, and PR workflow (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Thread safety section in architecture documentation.

### Changed

- Rewrote `README.md` with quick-start example, structured documentation links, and updated resource usage table.
- Adopted [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format for `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Refactored `doc/environment_setup.md` with prerequisites table, numbered workflow, and troubleshooting notes.
- Renamed `doc/features_candidates.md` to `doc/roadmap.md` with status and priority tracking.

### Fixed

- EBA table corruption during init when resolving sequence number conflicts (`ubi.c`: `item->key` was overwritten with PEB index instead of setting `item->value.pnum`).

### Removed

- `doc/features_candidates.md` (replaced by `doc/roadmap.md`).

## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-25

### Added

- Mutex-based synchronization for thread-safe device and volume operations.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-24

### Added

- Sample application demonstrating UBI initialization on STM32U5.

### Changed

- Optimized flash read/write operations to reduce unnecessary flash area open/close cycles.
- Improved logging messages across all modules.
- Deduplicated common code paths in volume and LEB operations.
- Reorganized source file structure for clarity.
- Updated Doxygen documentation for all public API functions.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-21

### Added

- `.clang-format` configuration file for consistent code style.

### Changed

- Replaced low-level Zephyr flash APIs with the Zephyr Flash Map (Flash Area API) for better portability and abstraction.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-10

### Added

- Volume support with static and dynamic volume types.
- Runtime resizing for dynamic volumes.
- Write block alignment handling (transparent to the caller).
- Partial dual-bank support for device and volume headers on reserved PEBs.
- Hardware integration tests on `b_u585i_iot02a`.

### Removed

- Hardware test documentation (superseded by updated environment setup guide).
- Temporary sample application (reintroduced in v0.4.0).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-25

### Added

- UBI device initialization and deinitialization routines.
- LEB and PEB statistics reporting, including per-PEB erase counters.
- LEB I/O operations: map, unmap, read, and write.
- Hardware integration tests on `b_u585i_iot02a`.
- Example application for `b_u585i_iot02a`.
- Environment setup documentation.
  - Hardware testing procedures.  
  - Candidate features for future development.  
- Clang-format script for consistent code formatting.
